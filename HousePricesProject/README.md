# HousePricesProject

This project analyzes the House Prices dataset to build a predictive model for house sale prices using machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Investigated missing values, cleaned the dataset by imputing missing data, and encoded categorical variables.
- **Data Visualization:** Explored relationships between features and the target variable (SalePrice) using plots.
- **Modeling:** Built and tuned a Random Forest regression model to predict house prices.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² metrics.
- **Interpretation:** Analyzed feature importance to understand key drivers of house prices.
- **Future Work:** Suggestions for improving the model with advanced techniques and deployment considerations.
